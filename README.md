# Traffic Flow Optimization Project

This project aims to optimize traffic flow using a combination of data processing, simulation, machine learning, and visualization techniques.

## Overview

The project consists of several components, each serving a specific purpose:

- **data_processing.py**: Process raw traffic data, generate input features for the AI model.
- **simulation.py**: Simulate traffic behavior and update traffic network state over time.
- **train_model.py**: Train an AI model using processed data and input features.
- **visualize.py**: Visualize simulation results or model predictions.
- **app.py**: FastAPI application serving as an interface to interact with different components.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-flow-optimization.git
   cd traffic-flow-optimization
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the FastAPI application:
   ```
   uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

4. Interact with the API:
   - `/simulate/`: POST endpoint to run a traffic simulation.
   - `/train/`: POST endpoint to train the AI model.
   - `/visualize/`: GET endpoint to display visualization results.

## Project Structure

- `data_processing.py`: Process raw traffic data and generate input features.
- `simulation.py`: Simulate traffic behavior and update the traffic network state.
- `train_model.py`: Train an AI model using processed data and input features.
- `visualize.py`: Visualize simulation results or model predictions.
- `app.py`: FastAPI application for API interactions.

## Customize

- Replace placeholders in the component scripts with actual data and logic.
- Adapt visualization and model training functions to your requirements.
- Configure simulation parameters and behavior.
